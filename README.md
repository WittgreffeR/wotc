# War of the Champions

A turn-based roguelike fighting game, where an aspiring champion proves themselves against semi-randomised AI opponents. Currently a work in progress; the game is not yet fully functional.

WotC.py must be in the same folder as the content folder for the program to run correctly.
You will not need to install any packages to run the program, but mypy is recommended for development.

The game can be modded without touching any of the actual code by modifying the .txt files in content/data and the parameters in content/config/settings.py, though make sure to follow the established format to avoid errors.
