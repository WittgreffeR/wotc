# War of the Champions

A turn-based roguelike fighting game, where an aspiring champion proves themselves against semi-randomised AI opponents. Currently a work in progress; the game is not yet fully functional.

WotC.py must be in the same folder as the content folder for the program to run correctly.
You will not need to install any packages to run the program, but mypy is recommended for development.
